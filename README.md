## Data source

## Econometric data analysis methods used

1. Ordinary least squares(OLS)regressions.
2. Students Ttest for significance.
3. Durbin Watson test for auto-correlation.
4. Joint hypothesis F-test for bias present in OLS coefficients.

## Results summary 

The results from this data analysis was that the volatility predicted by the option was a strong forecast for the volatility that was actually realised . I also found that the forecast was biased and proposed that this was caused by mis-specifications in the models commonly used by investors to determine the price of this instrument.
